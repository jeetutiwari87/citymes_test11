We want to develop a webapp where a user can register and once registered he can create and manage Telegram Bots and Telegram Channels from the webapp interface without the need of coding, all using simple forms where they can create custom commands for their Bots, publish messages to their channels etc. The users will have different custom levels, for example one user level will be able to have only one bot and one channel and have 10 custom commands and publish 1 message to their channel at a day, and level 2 users will be able to have 2 bots and 2 channels and 20 custom commands for each bot and publish 5 messages a day to their channels, for example.
